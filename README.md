# BiasVarianceTradeOff
This project explores the bias-variance trade-off, a fundamental concept in machine learning, through the lens of polynomial regression. The Python code takes you step-by-step through the process of generating data, visualizing it, and experimenting with different polynomial models to find the perfect balance between bias and variance.

Welcome to the Bias-Variance Trade-Off project! This repository contains a Python-based exploration of the bias-variance trade-off, a key concept in machine learning. The project demonstrates how to adjust model complexity using polynomial regression to achieve the best predictive performance on a dataset.

Introduction

The bias-variance trade-off is like finding the right balance between consistently missing the target and hitting it occasionally but inconsistently. In this project, you'll explore this balance using polynomial regression on a generated dataset, allowing you to see how different levels of model complexity affect performance.

This project is inspired by and references Python Data Science Handbook by Jake VanderPlas.

Project Structure

    data_generation.py: Script to generate the dataset.
    visualization.py: Script to visualize the dataset and model performance.
    model_training.py: Script to train and evaluate polynomial regression models.

Example

Below is a quick example of how to visualize the model performance:

python

from model_training import myPolynomialRegression

# Create and train a model
model = myPolynomialRegression(degree=5)
model.fit(Xtrain, yTrain)

# Predict and visualize
ypred = model.predict(Xtest)
plt.plot(Xtest.ravel(), ypred, label='degree 5')
plt.scatter(Xtrain.ravel(), yTrain, color='black')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
